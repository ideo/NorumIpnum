FONTLOG for the Norum Ipnum font families

This file provides detailed information on the Norum Ipsum Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Norum Ipnum fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Norum Ipnum is a set of numeral typefaces intended to replace numbers in graphical layouts where boilerplate numerals are needed.
These replacement numbers are intended to play the role that "Lorum Ipsum" text plays for mocking up copy, that is acting as a visual placeholder without conveying the presence of real numerical data.

Norum Ipnum only supports numerals 0-9 as well as "," "." and "-"

There are currently 3 Norum Ipnum families: Sans, Serif and Segment.
